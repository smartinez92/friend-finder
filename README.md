The original idea called for finding the first most compatible friend but I wasn't happy with that because I knew there would be many ties for compatibility as the database grew. I decided to add a random choice among the ties and the app worked out well. I seeded the database with all animal photos just for fun.

When I saw the photo that ended up as the background image, I knew I had the right styling. It kind of makes me smile when looking at the two red M&M's - perfect friends!
